# Realtime_FaceLandmark_Detection
Created a webcam stream using react app. Transfer learning is used to import facemesh which is a pre-trained deep learning library to detect the face from tensorflow.js and by using javascript canvas drew all the keypoints and traingles on the app.

## What is facial landmark detection

Machine learning technique that detects different points on your face. When you combine these together you're able to generate a mesh. The model in this video detects 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface geometry of a human face. This model is used in snapchat filters and there's so much more that it can be used for like emotion analysis and face tracking.

The model can also detect multiple faces at a time
